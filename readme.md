## Requirements
* [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [nix](https://nixos.org)
* [direnv](https://direnv.net/) (optional)

## Setting up
Run `nix-shell` to enter a shell containing `site` program for controlling the website. If you have `direnv` installed, you can instead run `direnv allow` and it will prepare the correct shell environment automatically, every time you enter the directory.

## Changing content
The website is generated by the `site` program based on the files in `pages/` directory and other directories in this tree. You can trigger the generation a single time by running `site build` or start a program that will regenerate the website on any change by running `site watch`.

The resulting website will be placed in the `public/` directory from which it can be uploaded to the server, either manually or by calling `site deploy`.

You can also run `site check` to check the website for broken links, and `site rebuild` when something breaks in such a way that `site build` does not notice some changes.
