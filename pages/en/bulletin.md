        Controls are marked on the map and control descriptions with a code. The first digit of the code, multiplied by 10, indicates the control's point value. For example, at checkpoints 40 to 49 you will get 40 points, checkpoints 70 to 79 have a point value of 70, etc. Any number of controls can be visited in any order.
        <br>
        Punching a control is registered by inserting the SI card into the SI stamping unit (it must flash and beep). The control is equipped with an orange and white kite measuring 30×30 cm, an SI unit and a red and white plastic strip with the control number and a letter - in case of electronic punching failure, you must write this letter down instead.<br>
        The team's position in the overall ranking is determined by the points achieved, and in the event of a tie, the lower time achieved. If the time limit is exceeded, 20 points will be deducted for each minute of delay. If the time limit is exceeded by 30 minutes or more, the team will be not be included in the final rankings.<br>
