We have just published [the final bulletin](/files/Final_Bulletin_CZRC_2025.pdf) for the race. Will you read it carefully please as there are some specifics of the race? The bulletin is going to reveal you that apart from the classic hash house, you can refresh and feed yourself in the "All Night Cafe" in Rezek brewery. Study in a detail which forests are accessible during the night, and which are banned at night. Don't forget that all competitors are eligible for a good meal after finishing the race. We're looking forward to seeing you tomorrow!

A warm welcome to the rogaining community from &nbsp;[Potkávárna u Havrana](https://www.potkavarnauhavrana.cz/) - a mountain lodge run by orienteers for orienteers and similar minded outdoor folks.

In the 5 years of our existence, we have had the honor of hosting orienteers, not only from Czech clubs and national teams, but also those from many other countries. We had the opportunity to meet various national teams before and during the 2021 Orienteering World Championships. And we organised the 2021 Czech Mountain Orienteering Championships. Now the time is right to organize the ultimate discipline of endurance - [rogaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogaining).
You can look forward to rogaining, which will take place in the southern part of the Jizera Mountains and in the foothills of Krkonoše.

Don't worry, we're not going into it alone. The great guru of rogaining and mountain orienteering Jan Tojnár himself is on board to share his plethora of advice, orienteers from&nbsp;[OK Roztoky](http://roz.ini.cz/) will help us, just like they did for the Czech Mountain Orienteering Championships, and the course planner is none other than the 1991 middle distance orienteering world champion Petr Kozák, also known as Kožak.

We are in the planning stage, we will keep you updated on our progress, and we will all hope together that no unforeseen situation will arise that would make the event impossible.
