A warm welcome to the mountain orienteering and rogaining community from [Potkávárna u Havrana](https://www.potkavarnauhavrana.cz/?lang=en) - a mountain lodge run by orienteers for orienteers and similar minded outdoor folks. WOC has finished and we had the privilige to watch it closely and host national squads from various countries.
But WOC is over now and we decided to accept an offer from Czech rogaining association vice president Jan Tojnar to organize the Czech mountain orienteering championships in the same area as the WOC middle race and adjacent training areas. We also invited our friends from [OK Roztoky orienteering club](http://roz.ini.cz/) to give us a hand.
Preparation is in full swing now and you can look forward to challenging mountain orienteering in the Jizera mountains. Let's hope it's not going to be stopped by Covid...
